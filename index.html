      <p>Bless up. Cloth talk. Stay focused. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.

Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed.</p>
